                  I just want to say that you are actually the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm so grateful to have you in my life. Through all of our ups and downs, you've taught me so much. You've helped me believe in myself. You've always been the one I work hard for because I want to grow and be better â€” for you.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I've never had anyone motivate me the way you do. You are amazing, caring, and the most perfect, sexy girlfriend. You're gentle, kind, and just wow. I love you so much.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I know we've had our poopy times, but I really hope everything feels different now and better in your eyes. I wish I could be there with you today, but we're going to celebrate like crazy on Saturday.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I wuv you so much, my bubu. I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives together â€” to raise our little dugus and bugus. I can't wait to marry you.
